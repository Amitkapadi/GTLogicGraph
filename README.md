# GraphViewExample

The intent of this project is to provide a generic graph view based on the new GraphView and VisualElements system found in Unity 2018, the same systems which the new ShaderGraph are based off of.

Currently this repo contains the source code of the GraphView and the source code of the visual element examples, alongside the source for the generic graph view in the GeoTetra/GTGenericGraph directory. This is done to easily cross reference and pull source from the ShaderGraph source, as much as possible the patterns of the ShaderGraph should be followed, and its classes relied upon.

Currently you can open the generic graph window from Window>GenericGraph. You can then right click to create nodes, drag the nodes around, drag a box to select multiple nodes, zoom in and out and drag the view around.

The intent is to create a feature filled basis off of which the new GraphView can be utilized to support any system.
